/// A pattern that performs matching of an asserting pattern from the current input position *backwards*, does not move the input position of matches beyond the assertion, and produces exactly one match if the asserting pattern produces a match; also known as a positive lookbehind.
///
/// A backward assertion is also a singular pattern: as soon as it finds one match over its asserting pattern, it does not generate more matches over its asserting pattern. This does not affect pattern matching in general since the input position isn't affected by an assertion pattern, but it does affect the tokens used within the asserting pattern since the assertion pattern will not permute over all possible captures of the asserting pattern's tokens.
public struct BackwardAssertion<AssertingPattern : Pattern> {
	
	/// The pattern that is matched on the subsequence up to the input position.
	///
	/// If the pattern does not produce matches, the assertion fails and produces no matches itself.
