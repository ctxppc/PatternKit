/// A description of a subsequence within a sequence.
///
/// Given a sequence and an input position, a pattern can determine a subsequence within the sequence, starting from the input position which is said to conform or **match** the pattern. Moreover, a pattern can determine any number of possible subsequences, including none.
///
/// To conform to this protocol, implement the `matchStates(entryState:)` method which takes a match state and generates some number of successor states. A match state encapsulates a current state in the pattern matching routine; successor states are all possible match states that result after `self` has performed pattern matching.
///
/// Most clients of patterns should use the convenience methods `matches(in:)`, `firstMatch(in:)`, or `hasMatches(in:)` which as a bonus perform some optimisations.
